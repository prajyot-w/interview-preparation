You need to write a simple Java program to check if a given String is palindrome or not. A Palindrome is a String which
is equal to the reverse of itself e.g. "Bob" is a palindrome because of the reverse of "Bob" is also "Bob".  Though be
prepared with both recursive and iterative solution of this problem. The interviewer may ask you to solve without using
any library method e.g. indexOf() or subString() so be prepared for that.
